To-Do List Application with Local Storage

This project is a simple yet functional To-Do List application built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently with persistent data storage using Local Storage.

Key Features:

Add New Tasks: Users can create new tasks that will be displayed in the list.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, with a visual indicator showing the taskâ€™s status.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks individually, and the changes will be reflected instantly. 
Persistent Data with Local Storage: All tasks, including their completion status, are stored in Local Storage. This ensures that tasks remain saved even after refreshing or closing the browser. 
Interactive UI: The app is designed to be user-friendly with clear buttons for adding, deleting, and marking tasks. 
Responsive Design: The to-do list is fully responsive and works seamlessly on various devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile). 
This project demonstrates my skills in JavaScript, specifically in managing state and data persistence using Local Storage, along with creating an intuitive and responsive user interface.
